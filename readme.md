## Instructions and Warnings

*Warning*: When importing the project into your IDE, import the project as a Maven Project. If you have issues building it, the problem is most likely a IDE configuration issue. Since most originally cloned the project when it was being built using Graddle, your IDE's configuration have been set automatically to use Graddle to build the project.

Mark Directory as... Test Sources Folder (src/test/java) in your ide if using IntelliJ. There is most likely an equivalent ide setting for eclipse users.

1. Open your IDE (Ideally ItelliJ) and import the repository as a Maven Project. On IntelliJ, you can also press on the "Check out from Version Control" and it wil prompt you for the repository URL. This URL can be found under the "Clone or Download" button of the Github page.

2. Once the repository is imported, the left side of the IDE should display the directory of all the files related to GarageBand. From there, the file called GarageManagementSystemApplication.java can be found by following the path:


> SOEN343 [garage-management-system] > src > main > java > com.soen343.gms > GarageManagementSystemApplication.java

3. Now right click GarageManagementSystemApplication.java and run it

4. Go to a web browser and type in localhost:8080 (depends on your IDE configuartion) and from there you should have access to Garage Band.
