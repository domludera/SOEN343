## Team Somena - Garage Band

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS (PLEASE READ):

When importing the project into your IDE, import the project as a Maven Project.
Most popular IDEs have maven integration built-in (I recommend IntelliJ).
If you have issues building the project, the problem is most likely a IDE configuration issue.

Since most originally cloned the project when the project was being built using Graddle,
your IDE's configuration have been set automatically to use Graddle to build the project.
Changing IDE configurations manually is not a trivial task.

**You should re-clone the project as a completely new Maven project to have the IDE automatically build the project with Maven (DO NOT simply git pull!).**

I wish you all an easy build!
